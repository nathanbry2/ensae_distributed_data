# Distributed Data

This repository hosts the project for the Distributed Data course at ENSAE, made by Nathan BRY & CÃ©dric VONIN. 

Through a quick implementation in Python, we show how Parallel Computing techniques such as **Multithreading** and **Multiprocessing** can significantly reduce the computation time for training and optimizing Machine Learning models.
